## Overview

This repository contains 50 questions and answers focusing on advanced NumPy concepts and commonly used functions in data engineering. It's designed to enhance your understanding of NumPy.

## Key Concepts

- **Arrays and Data Types**: Creating arrays and understanding data types.
- **Array Creation Functions**: Using functions like `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`, `numpy.arange()`, and `numpy.linspace()`.
- **Array Reshaping and Manipulation**: Techniques such as `reshape()`, `transpose()`, and `flatten()`.
- **Array Indexing and Slicing**: Accessing elements using indices, slices, and boolean indexing.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performing element-wise operations and using universal functions (ufuncs).
- **Statistical Functions**: Computing mean, standard deviation, and sum.
- **Linear Algebra Operations**: Executing dot products, matrix inversions, and eigenvalue computations.
- **Random Sampling**: Generating random samples with functions like `rand()`, `randn()`, and `randint()`.

## Installation
